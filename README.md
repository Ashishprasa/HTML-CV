# HTML-CV
I have decided to create this webpage as a personal project to test my skills in using only HTML language. HTML is the foundation of web development and I want to master its syntax and features. By creating this webpage, I hope to learn more about HTML elements, attributes, links, images, tables, forms, and other components. I also want to challenge myself to make this webpage as attractive and functional as possible without using any CSS or JavaScript. This is my way of honing my HTML proficiency and exploring its possibilities.
